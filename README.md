# How Technology can answer healthcare main challenges - Capgemini
by Fares EMBOUZZA & Pierre TOURNEUR & Christian BONNAUD & Mohamed Amin MALLEK and with the support of Esteban ESTOC

## Description of our project

The main goal of our application is to prevent the users of back pain and eye strain during their working time on a computer.

We have made a desktop application with further features : 
  - Initialisation of the good posture
  - Detection in real time if we move to a worst posture for our back
  - Detection of the  distance between eyes and screen
  - Detection of the room luminosity
  - Overworking detection
  
Those different detections allow the application to warn the user if he stays too long in a bad position or in a dark room and if you stay too long on the computer. Three could hurt you so the application does the prevention with warning pop-up.
